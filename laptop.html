<p class="paragraph">The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_laptops">history of laptops</a> describes the efforts in the 1970s and 1980s to build small, portable personal computers that combine the components, inputs, outputs
 and capabilities of a desktop computer in a small chassis. Before laptop/notebook computers were technically feasible, similar ideas had been proposed, most 
 notably <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a>'s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyanbook">Dynabook</a> concept, developed

<p class="paragraph">The portable micro computer the "<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Computer_science">Portal</a>" of the French company R2E Micral CCMC officially appeared in September 1980 at the Sicob show in
 Paris. The Portal was a portable microcomputer designed and marketed by the studies and developments department of the French firm R2E Micral in 1980 at the
 request of the company CCMC specializing in payroll and accounting. It was based on an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8085">Intel 8085 processor</a>, 8-bit, clocked at 2 MHz. It was equipped with a
 central 64K byte Ram, a keyboard with 58 alpha numeric keys and 11 numeric keys (separate blocks), a 32-character screen, a floppy disk: capacity = 140 000
 characters, of a thermal printer: speed = 28 characters / second, an asynchronous channel, a synchronous channel, a 220 V power supply. Designed for an 
 operating temperature of 15–35 ° C, it weighed 12 kg and its dimensions were 45 × 45 × 15 cm. It provided total mobility. Its operating system was Prologue.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The Osborne 1 is considered the first true mobile computer by most historians.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Osborne">Adam Osborne</a> founded 
Osborne Computer and formed the Osborne 1 in 1981. The Osborne 1 had a five-inch screen, incorporating a modem port, two 5 1/4 floppy drives, a big collection
 of bundled software applications, and a battery pack. The computer company was a failure and did not last for very long. Although it was large and heavy 
 compared to today's laptops, with a tiny 5" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube">CRT</a> monitor, it had a near-revolutionary impact on 
 business, as professionals were able to take their computer and data with them for the first time. This and other "luggables" were inspired by what was 
 probably the first portable computer, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_NoteTaker">Xerox NoteTaker</a>. The Osborne was about the size of a 
 portable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewing_machine">sewing machine</a>, and could be carried on commercial aircraft. The Osborne 1 weighed close

<div style="text-align:center;" class="imagecaption"><img src="compaq-portable.jpg"><div style="text-align:center;"> In 1982,Compaq Portable</div></div>
<p class="paragraph">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_Portable">Compaq Portable</a> was the first portable computer created in 1982 which one of the first 100% IBM PC compatible systems. The first shipment was in March 1983 
and was priced at $2,995. The Compaq Portable folded up into a luggable case the size of a portable sewing machine. The third model of this development, Compaq
 Portable II, featured high resolution graphics on its tube display. It was the first portable computer ready to be used on the shop floor, and for CAD and 
 diagram display. It established Compaq as a major brand on the market.
<h3 class="heading">1983:Commodore SX-64</h3>
<div style="text-align:center;" class="imagecaption"><img src="Commodore_SX-64.jpg"><div style="text-align:center;"> In 1983,Commodore SX-64</div></div>
<p class="paragraph">
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_SX-64">Commodore SX-64</a>, also known as the Executive 64, or VIP-64 in Europe, was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_computer">
portable</a>, briefcase or suitcase-size "luggable" version of the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a> home computer
 and was the first full-color portable computer.</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The SX-64 featured a built-in five-inch composite monitor and a built-in 1541 floppy drive. It weighed 20 pounds. The machine was carried by its sturdy
 handle, which doubled as an adjustable stand. It was announced in January 1983 and released a year later, at $995 USD.</p>

The first significant development towards laptop computing was announced in 1981 and sold from July 1983, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epson_HX-
20">Epson HX-20</a>. A simple handheld computer, it featured a full-transit 68-key keyboard, rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries, a small (120×32-pixel) dot-
matrix LCD with 4 lines of text, 20 characters per line text mode, a 24 column <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer">dot matrix printer
</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC">Microsoft BASIC</a> interpreter, and 16 KB of RAM (expandable to 32 KB). Through at least the 
late 1980s, Epson continued to release laptops such as the L3s. The HX-20s very limited screen, tiny internal memory and lack of mass storage support, made 
serious  word-processing and spreadsheet applications impractical and the device was described as "primitive" by some.</p>
 <h2 class="headings">Grid Compass</h2> 
<div style="text-align:center;" class="imagecaption"><img src="grid compass.jpg"><div style="text-align:center;"> In 1982,Grid Compass</div></div>
<p class="paragraph">The first laptop in the modern form was the Grid Compass 1101, designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Moggridge">Bill 
Moggridge</a> in 1979–80, and released in 1982. Enclosed in a magnesium case, it introduced the now familiar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_(form)">
clamshell</a> design, in which the flat display folded shut against the keyboard. The computer was equipped with a 320×200-pixel <a href="https://en.wikipedi

 It was not IBM-compatible, and its high price (US$8,000–10,000) limited it to specialized applications. However, it was used heavily by the U.S. military, and
 by NASA on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> during the 1980s. The GRiD's manufacturer
 subsequently earned significant returns on its patent rights as its innovations became commonplace. GRiD Systems Corp. was later bought by the Tandy
 (now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack">RadioShack</a>) Corporation. The Grid's portablity was restricted as it had no internal battery pack
 and relied on mains power.

<h2 class="headings">Dulmont Magnum/Kookaburra</h2> 
<div style="text-align:center;" class="imagecaption"><img src="dulmont magnum.jpg"><div style="text-align:center;"> In 1983,Dulmont Magnum/Kookaburra</div></div>
<p class="paragraph">The first contender for true laptop computing was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulmont_Magnum">Dulmont Magnum</a>, designed by David Irwin and John Blair of Dulmison, Australia, 
in 1982 and released in Australia in September 1983 by Dulmont. This battery-powered device included an 80 character × 8 line display in a lid that closed 
against the keyboard. The Dulmont was thus the first computer that could be taken anywhere and offered significant computing potential on the user's laptop
 (though weighing in at 4.8 kg). It was based on the MS-DOS operating system and applications stored in ROM (A:) and also supported removable modules in 
 expansion slots (B: and C:) that could be custom programmed EPROM or standard word processing and spreadsheet applications. The Magnum could suspend and 
 retain memory in battery-backed CMOS RAM, including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_drive">RAM Disk</a> (D:). A separate expansion box provided dual 5.25-inch floppy or 10 MB hard disk storage. 
 The product was marketed internationally from 1984 to 1986.[3] Dulmont was eventually taken over by Time Office Computers, who relabelled the brand 
 "Kookaburra" and marketed 16 and 25-line LCD display versions.</p>
 <h2 class="headings">Sharp and Gavilan</h2> 
<div style="text-align:center;" class="imagecaption"><img src="gailvan sc.jpg"><div style="text-align:center;"> In 1983,Gavilan</div></div>

respects to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulmont_Magnum">Dulmont Magnum</a>) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavilan_SC">Gavilan 
SC</a>, announced
 in 1983 but first sold in 1984, Gavilan filing bankruptcy the same year. The Gavilan was notably the first computer to be marketed as a "laptop". It was
 equipped with an internal floppy disk drive and a pioneering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad">touchpad</a>-like <a href="https://en.wikip

 i/BASIC">BASIC</a> interpreter, a text editor, and a terminal program, were supplied by Microsoft, and
 was written in part by Bill Gates himself. The computer was not a clamshell, but provided a tiltable 8 line × 40-character LCD screen above a full-travel
 keyboard. With its internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem">modem</a>, it was a highly portable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal">communications terminal</a>. Due to its
 portability, good battery life (and ease of replacement),
 reliability (it had no moving parts), and low price (as little as US$300), the model was highly regarded, becoming a favorite among journalists. It weighed
 less than 2 kg with dimensions of 30×21.5×4.5 centimeters (12×8½×1¾ in). Initial specifications included 8 kilobytes of RAM (expandable to 24 KB) and a 3 MHz 
 processor. The machine was in fact about the size of a paper notebook, but the term had yet to come into use and it was generally described as a "portable" 
 computer.</p>

 as <i>"the world's first mass-market laptop computer"</i>.It did not have a hard drive, and ran entirely from floppy disks. The CPU was a 4.77 MHz 
Intel 80C88, a variation of the popular  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088">Intel 8088</a>, and the display was a
 monochrome, text-only 640x200 LCD. It was followed in 1987 by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba_T1000">T1000</a> and <a href="
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba_T1200">T1200</a>. Although limited floppy-based DOS machines, with the operating system

 models featured an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286">Intel 80286</a> processor and a 20 MB hard disk drive. On the strength of this deal,
 ZDS became the world's largest laptop supplier in 1987 and 1988. ZDS partnered with Tottori Sanyo in the design and manufacturing of these laptops. This 
 relationship is notable because it was the first deal between a major brand and an Asian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer">
